# Typeform Data API Tests

Small test suite to explore Typeform's Data API and practice setting up a project from the ground.

Using SuperTest, Mocha, Chai and Mochawesome reporter.

I used a basic Registration form in my Typeform account for which I created some responses (manually :( ) but ideally all that test data would be created dynamically as a test setup.

## Easy peasy setup
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run the tests:
    1. Run `npm test` to run all the tests
    2. Run `npm run testReport` to run tests and generate a **Mochawesome** report
